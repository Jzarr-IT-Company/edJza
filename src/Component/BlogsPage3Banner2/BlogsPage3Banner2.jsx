Page speed is a big deal for mobile SEO. Google says it's a ranking factor. Fast-loading sites keep visitors engaged and interested. This leads to better user experience, lower bounce rates, and more conversions.
<br />
To improve your site for mobile and speed, try these strategies:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Leverage Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP): AMP makes mobile pages load fast. It's backed by Google and meets Core Web Vitals requirements.
                                </li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Optimize Images and Media: Big, uncompressed images slow down sites. Use the right formats, compress images, and serve responsive images for different devices.

                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Minimize HTTP Requests: Each request for images, scripts, or stylesheets slows down your site. Reduce requests by combining assets, using CDNs, and lazy loading.

                                <li>Enable Browser Caching: Caching lets browsers store site resources. This cuts down on resources needed on future visits, making sites load faster.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
