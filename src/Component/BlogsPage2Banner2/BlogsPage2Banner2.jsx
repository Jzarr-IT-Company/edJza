                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Fundamentals of Web Development</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Web development includes coding and technical work to create websites. It can be divided into three main parts:
                            </p>
                            <ol>

                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Good web design is not just about looking nice. It also focuses on user experience. Key principles include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Simplicity: </strong>Clean designs help users navigate easily.</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Consistency: </strong>Using similar styles across pages creates a cohesive look.</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Websites should be usable for people with disabilities. This includes text that is easy to read and alt text for images.
                                </li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Visual Hierarchy:</strong> Important information should stand out using size, color, and placement.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>These principles help developers design sites that are user-friendly and effective.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Differentiating Between Frontend and Backend</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Frontend and backend development are crucial to creating a complete website.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Frontend: </strong> Deals with visual aspects. Developers focus on the layout, colors, and fonts. They ensure everything works well across devices.</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'><strong>Backend: </strong>Looks after the server, database, and application. Backend developers ensure that everything processes correctly.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>The two areas must work together. A good website needs both strong visual design and solid functionality. Understanding the difference helps new developers focus on gaining the right skills.</p>

                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Creating a portfolio website involves careful thought about its purpose and design. A focused plan helps ensure the website meets the developer’s goals and appeals to the right audience.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="">
                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Defining the Purpose and Audience</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>First, it is essential to define the website’s purpose. The main goal is to showcase skills and projects. Is it to attract employers, clients, or collaborators?
                                <br />
                                Identifying the audience helps shape the content and design. Different audiences have varying expectations. For example, employers look for professionalism, while potential clients may seek creativity.
                                <br />
                                Creating a list of key features can help. Some important questions include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>What skills need to be displayed?</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>How will it show unique personal branding?</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Wireframing and Prototyping</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Once the purpose is clear, wireframing is the next step. A wireframe is a simple sketch of the website layout. It helps visualize how the website will look without distractions.
                                <br />
                                Using tools like Figma or Sketch can make this easier. Wireframes should outline key sections: the homepage, project pages, and contact forms.
                                <br />
                                Next, prototyping allows for better navigation testing. This can be a clickable mockup that helps in identifying design flaws. Prototypes help visualize user experience, making adjustments simpler before building the actual site.</p>

                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Selecting a Suitable Domain Name</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Choosing a domain name is crucial. It should reflect the developer’s name or brand. A unique and memorable domain helps visitors recall the website easily.
                                <br />
                                When selecting a domain, consider these tips:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Keep it short and simple.</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Avoid numbers and special characters.</li>
                                <li className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Check for availability on domain registration sites.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Choosing the right domain also means thinking about the extension. Common options like .com or .net are popular. However, niche extensions (like .design) can also be effective, depending on the audience.</p>

                            <h5 className='fw-bold'>Choosing the Right Development Tools</h5>
                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Selecting the right tools is vital for building a portfolio. Beginners should start with user-friendly platforms. WordPress is popular for its ease of use and flexibility. It allows for quick setup and a range of themes to choose from.
                                <br />
                                Alternatively, Wix and Squarespace offer drag-and-drop features, making design simple. For those wanting to code, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is useful. These languages provide more control over the design.
                                <br />
                                Many beginners also seek online resources, such as GitHub, to host projects. This allows others to see their code and contributions. Selecting the right tools sets a solid foundation for any portfolio website.</p>

                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>When creating a portfolio, it’s key to include essential features. First, a clear homepage that introduces the developer is crucial. It should have a brief bio and an eye-catching design.
                                <br />
                                Next, a projects page is necessary to showcase work. Include images, descriptions, and links to live projects. This gives visitors insight into skills and experiences.
                                <br />
                                Adding a contact form is also important. This allows potential employers or collaborators to easily reach out. Beginners should also consider including a blog section to share thoughts and projects. This shows ongoing learning and engagement in the field.</p>

                                Using comments in the code can clarify complex sections. This is especially helpful when others view or contribute. Additionally, adhering to best practices for each programming language helps maintain quality.

                                Lastly, beginners should learn about version control systems like Git. This keeps track of changes and helps in collaborating with others. Clean, maintainable code boosts credibility and support for future projects.</p>

                            <p className='text-secondary fw-semibold'>Security is critical for every website. A recommended plugin for this purpose is <strong>Wordfence Security</strong>.
